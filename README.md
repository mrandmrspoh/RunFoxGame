# Background


I created "Run, Fox!" for my toddler son. The objective of this game is to help Mr Fox run as far as he can by jumping over hurdles that come along the way!
To create a unique experience, I have programmed a variety of hurdles, which are randomly generated, with increasing complexity over time.


# Game Instructions

To jump, press the UP arrow key. To run forward or backwards, press the RIGHT or LEFT arrow key.
